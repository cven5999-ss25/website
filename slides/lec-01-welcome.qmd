# Version Control

## Version Control with Git and GitHub

A way to share files with others, so they can:

- download
- re-use
- contribute

You can view the history of files, and jump back in time to any point. 


## Why is it useful?

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="40%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/lec-01/phd_comics_vc.gif")
```

## Git and GitHub 

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="25%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/lec-01/git-logo.png")
```
- Git is a software for version control
- Released in 2005
- Popular among programmers collaboratively developing code 
- Tracks changes in a set of files (directory/folder/repository)
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="25%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/lec-01/github-logo.png")
```
- GitHub is a hosting platform for version control using Git
- Launched in 2008, aquired by Microsoft in in 2018, Microsoft for US$ 7.5 billion
- 73 million Users ([February, 2022](https://github.com/about))
- Facebook for Software Developers

::: {.notes}

1. First you must import your data into R. This typically means that you take data stored:

- in a file
- in a database, 
- or web application, and load it into R. 

2. If you can get your data into R, you can  do data science on it!

:::

## - {background-image="img/lec-01/data-science-lifecycle/data-science-lifecycle.003.png" background-size="contain"}

::: {.notes}

1. Once you’ve imported your data, it is a good idea to tidy it. 

2. This means to get it into a structure that lets you focus on the questions about your data and not the format it needs to be in

3. This is the step where we spend by far the biggest amount of our time. 

4. It has been estimated that we spend about 80% of our time with cleaning and tidying data, so that we can use it fo our analyses.

5. In my courses you will learn how to structure your data in a tidy format as you collect it, and before you import it. A highly underestimated skill.

:::

## - {background-image="img/lec-01/data-science-lifecycle/data-science-lifecycle.004.png" background-size="contain"}

::: {.notes}

1. Once your data is tidy, a common first step is to transform it.

2. This includes 
- narrowing in on what interests you (like all people without toilets in one district, or all data from last year)
- creating new variables from existing (like toilet density, as in number of people per toilet) 
- calculating summary statistics (like counts or the mean)

Together, tidying and transforming are called wrangling, because getting your data in a form that’s natural to work with often feels like a fight!

:::

## - {background-image="img/lec-01/data-science-lifecycle/data-science-lifecycle.005.png" background-size="contain"}

::: {.notes}

1. Once you have tidy data with the variables you need, there are two main engines of knowledge generation: 

- visualisation 
- and modelling. 

2. These have complementary strengths and weaknesses so any real analysis will iterate between them many times.

3. Visualisation is a fundamentally human activity. A good visualisation will show you things that you did not expect, or raise new questions about the data.

:::

## - {background-image="img/lec-01/data-science-lifecycle/data-science-lifecycle.006.png" background-size="contain"}

::: {.notes}

1. Models are complementary tools to visualisation. Once you have made your questions sufficiently precise, you can use a model to answer them.

2. In my courses, they play a very small part, but I am confident that you will be able to enhance your knowledge on modelling once you understand the basic principles of using the R lanuage.

:::

## - {background-image="img/lec-01/data-science-lifecycle/data-science-lifecycle.007.png" background-size="contain"}

::: {.notes}

1. The last step of data science is communication, an absolutely critical part of any data analysis project. 

2. It doesn’t matter how well your models and visualisation have led you to understand the data, unless you can also communicate your results to others.

3. And this is a part where R has become really strong.

**R Packages**

Packages

- Main way that reusable code is shared in R
- Combination of code, data, and documentation
- R has a rich ecosystem of packages for data manipulation & analysis

## Functions & Arguments {auto-animate="true"}

```{r}
#| code-line-numbers: "3-4"
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
library(dplyr)

filter(.data = gapminder, 
       year == 2007)
```

- Function: `filter()`
- Argument: `.data = ` 
- Arguments following: `year == 2007` **What do do with the data**

## Objects {auto-animate="true"}

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| code-line-numbers: "3-4"
#| echo: true
library(dplyr)

gapminder_yr_2007 <- filter(.data = gapminder, 
                            year == 2007)
```

- Function: `filter()`
- Argument: `.data = `
- Arguments following: `year == 2007` **What do do with the data**
- Object: `gapminder_yr_2007`

## Operators {auto-animate="true"}

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| code-line-numbers: "3-4"
#| echo: true
library(dplyr)

gapminder_yr_2007 <- gapminder |> 
  filter(year == 2007) 
```

- Function: `filter()`
- Argument: `.data = `
- Arguments following: `year == 2007` **What do do with the data**
- Object: `gapminder_yr_2007`
- Assignment operator: `<-`
- Pipe operator: `|>`

## Rules

Rules of `dplyr` functions:

::: {.incremental}

- First argument is always a data frame
- Subsequent arguments say what to do with that data frame
- Always return a data frame  
- Don't modify in place
